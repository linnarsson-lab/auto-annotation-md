Cells possessing (typically) inhibitory GABAergic presynaptic terminals. 

Justification:

* Express Gad2, enzyme required to produce GABA
* Express Slc32a1, the vesicular GABA transporter
* Does not express Slc6a5 (GLYT2), the glycine transporter, which would make them glycinergic

Note: Gad1 is typically expressed in these cells, but is more promiscuous and less reliably expressed in GABA neurons.
